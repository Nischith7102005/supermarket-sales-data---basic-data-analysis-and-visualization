🛒 Supermarket Sales Data – Analysis with Python
This is a beginner project where I used Python in Google Colab to look at supermarket sales data. I used charts to understand which products sold the most and how male and female customers spent.

📁 Dataset
File: supermarket_sales_sample.csv

It contains 500 sales records from a supermarket

Includes: Date, City, Product line, Gender, Total amount, etc.

🔧 Tools Used
Google Colab, Python, pandas, matplotlib.

📊 What I Did
1]Opened the CSV file using pandas
2]Checked sales by product category
3]Compared spending between male and female customers
4]Made bar and pie charts to show the results

📈 Charts Included
✅ Bar chart of total sales by product line
✅ Pie chart showing sales split by gender
✅ What I Learned
1] How to use pandas to open and explore data
2] How to make simple graphs using matplotlib
3] How to find useful information from a dataset
